# Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a web automation system using FastAPI for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend.

## 2. System Overview
The system captures screenshots of multiple URLs, resizes images, and sends emails with the screenshots using predefined templates. It provides a user-friendly web interface for these operations.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Input
- Users can input multiple URLs.
- Users can specify the desired image size.
- Users can select or upload an email template.

### 3.2 Screenshot Capture
- The system captures screenshots of the provided URLs.
- Screenshots are saved in a specified directory.

### 3.3 Image Processing
- The system resizes the captured images according to user specifications.

### 3.4 Email Sending
- Users can send emails with the captured screenshots.
- The system uses predefined email templates.
- The system sends emails to specified recipients.

### 3.5 Web Interface
- The system provides a web interface using Streamlit.
- Users can interact with the system through the web interface.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- The system should handle multiple URL inputs efficiently.
- The system should process and send emails within a reasonable time frame.

### 4.2 Usability
- The web interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
- The system should provide clear feedback on the status of operations.

### 4.3 Reliability
- The system should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- The system should log all operations and errors for troubleshooting.

### 4.4 Security
- Sensitive information such as email credentials should be stored securely.
- The system should validate all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## 5. System Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI for handling API requests.
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for the web interface.
- **Screenshot Service**: Selenium with Chromedriver for capturing screenshots.
- **Email Service**: SMTP library for sending emails.
- **File Storage**: Local file system for storing images and templates.

## 6. Deployment
- The system will be containerized using Docker.
- CI/CD pipelines will be set up using GitHub Actions.

## 7. Testing
- Unit tests for individual functions.
- Integration tests for interactions between modules.
- Functional tests for end-to-end scenarios.

## 8. Additional Considerations
- Error handling for screenshot capture and email sending.
- Performance optimization for URL loading.
- Scheduling for periodic tasks.
- Logging for system operations and errors.
- Scalability and modularity for future enhancements.
- Monitoring for system performance and health.

This document provides a high-level overview of the requirements for the web automation system. Further details can be added as the project progresses.
